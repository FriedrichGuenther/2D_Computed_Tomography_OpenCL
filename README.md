# This repository contains a very small program written in OpenCL capable of performing basic 2D-computer tomography, i.e. computing the radon transform of a square input image (currently also requiring the resolution per edge to be divisible by 4), filtering the radon transform and performing the discrete back projection. 
# The directory "SLP" contains rasters of the famous Shepp Logan phantom, the directory "Output" contains sample output generated by the program, the directory "Kernels" contains the OpenCL kernels used for the computations.
